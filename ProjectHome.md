TLD v1.0


TLD is an algorithm for tracking of unknown objects in unconstrained video streams.
The object of interest is defined by a bounding box in a single frame. TLD simulta-
neously tracks the object, learns its appearance and detects it whenever it appears
in the video. The result is a real-time tracking that typically improves over time.

INSTALATION


1. Compile mex files: edit and execute "compile.m"
> Requires: OpenCV
> Tested using MS Visual Studio 2010 compiler and OpenCV2.2
2. Execute "run\_TLD.m" with default parameters. The TLD should track a motorbike
> from "_input" and store the results to "_output".
